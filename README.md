# SubTitleBingo
A tool which capable to  adjust your srt subtitle timeline. 
Build by jlink, and package by jlink. So, you can create a self contain running img,easy and small.
I'll try to upload the mac img(as soon as i find out how to do this in github, no guarantee), be my guest to create your own  running img. Leave me a message if I can do anything for you, except this one. lol

I did hide some easter eggs, eg, plain text encoding auto detect(Thanks to mozilia jchartdet) .Have fun guys.
